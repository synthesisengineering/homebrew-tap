  # v5 installs its own `synthesis` command (~/.local/bin/synthesis, linked to the runtime the
  # plugin keeps current), so this formula ships only the launcher that runs the onboarding.
  # A second `synthesis` here would shadow or diverge from the runtime the harnesses use.
  def install
    libexec.install "onboard.sh"

  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Install the plugin in Claude Code, Codex and Muse, the runtime and the `synthesis` command:
        synthesis-onboard
      Then restart each app, and approve the synthesis hooks in Codex (/hooks) and in Muse
      (muse plugins approve synthesis-skills). `synthesis doctor` checks the result.
